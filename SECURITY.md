# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repository is focused on **learning and practicing Data Structures & Algorithms**.
It does not contain production code, deployed services, or runtime dependencies.

That said, I actively maintain the **latest version** of this repository to ensure:
- Clean code
- Correct logic
- Safe usage of Python standard libraries

| Version / Branch | Supported |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| `main` (latest)  | ✅ Yes    |
| Older commits    | ❌ No     |

Only the **latest code in the `main` branch** is considered supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Although this is a **learning-focused repository**, I take security and code safety seriously.

If you discover:
- Unsafe coding practices
- Vulnerable or misleading logic
- Use of insecure libraries or patterns
- Any issue that could cause unexpected behavior

Please report it responsibly.

### 📬 How to Report
- Open a **GitHub Issue** with the label `security`
- Clearly describe:
  - The problem
  - Where it occurs (file name / problem)
  - Suggested fix (if possible)

### ⏱ Response Time
- You can expect an initial response within **3–5 days**
- If the issue is valid, it will be fixed and documented
- If declined, a clear explanation will be provided

## Scope

This security policy applies only to:
- Code examples
- Algorithms
- Python implementations

It does **not** apply to:
- External platforms (LeetCode, LinkedIn, etc.)
- Third-party content linked in the repository
